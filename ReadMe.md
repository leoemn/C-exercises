## Introduction

This repository is designed to provide you with a range of C programming exercises that cover various topics and concepts. Whether you are a beginner looking to strengthen your understanding of the basics or an intermediate-level programmer aiming to refine your skills, you will find exercises suited to your level.

## Exercises

Here is a list of exercises included in this repository:

1. Exercise 1.1: Write a C program that takes an integer as input and prints all the prime numbers less than or equal to that number.
2. Exercise 1.2: Write a C program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a recursive function.
3. Exercise 1.3: Write a C program that reads a sentence from the user and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the sentence.
4. Exercise 1.4: Write a C program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.
5. Exercise 1.5: Write a C program to find the sum of the digits of a given number using a loop.
6. Exercise 1.6: Write a C program that reads a text file and counts the occurrences of each word in the file. Print the words along with their frequencies.
7. Exercise 1.7: Write a C program that simulates a simple calculator. It should take two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input and perform the corresponding operation.
8. Exercise 1.8: Write a C program to sort an array of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
9. Exercise 1.9: Write a C program that calculates the average, maximum, and minimum of a given array of numbers.
10. Exercise 1.10: Write a C program to convert a decimal number to binary representation.

Each exercise is accompanied by a description that outlines the task or problem to solve. You will also find a corresponding solution file for each exercise.
